# Before and After Progress App


Full-stack Application using React.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Node.js (Nodemon preferred)

## About

For my project three, my app is aimed at creating a series of progress photos for someone with plans to lose weight. This app will make the weight loss process much easier and will allow the user to see the comparison of changes in their body. My goal is to have an upload middleware that allows photos to be uploaded. I also would like to have a login protocol that will verify the password using bcrypt.

## Future Updates and Lessons Learned

My future goal is to have full CRUD on all three models and have an image import function for users. I would also like to have authentication for my users. I also want my photos to import side by side, and only allow two photos to be shown on a page at a time. I would like there to be functionality that automatically compares day 1 with day 15, 30, 45 and 90 as you hit each milestone.
